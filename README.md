<h2>Azure SIEM Lab</h2>
<h2>Description</h2>
in order to enhance cybersecurity measures in this project, a virtual machine was set up as a honeypot. To monitor and track any potential threats, a PowerShell script was employed to log failed RDP brute force attempts, which were extracted from the event viewer. In order to obtain geolocation data from the attacks, a third-party website was utilized. To centralize and analyze this information, a log analytics workspace was configured in Azure, allowing for seamless integration with the honeypot PowerShell script. Additionally, an Azure Sentinel workbook was customized to present the data from log analytics on a world map, precisely pinpointing the origin of the attack. This comprehensive setup significantly bolstered the ability to detect and respond to potential security breaches.
